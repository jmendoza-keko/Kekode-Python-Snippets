## Variables
Allows you to label/name a value and save it to the computer's working memory.
```python
my_int = 3

my_float = 3.14

my_string = 'my string'

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Once a value is in working memory, you can have the computer recall it using the given variable name.
```python
answer = 1 + 2
# show the answer in the output window
print(answer)
# 3
```

You can re-use a variable name for a new value but, the previous value will be forgotten.
```python
answer = 1 + 2 # this value is forgotten
answer = 2 + 2 
print(answer)
# 4
```

A variable can be used in place of any other value.
```python
```
