# Kekode Python Snippets

```python
# defining a variable
my_variable = 123

# getting a user's input
user_input = input('Question to ask user')

# random choice from a list
random_choice = random.choice([1,2,3])

# branching your logic
result = 0
if result > 1:
  result = result - 1
print result
```

## Data Types
Integer = Whole number
```python
3
```

Float = Number with decimal
```python
3.14
```

String = Text
```python
'This is a string'
"This is also a string"
```

List = A list of values
```python
['a', 'b', 'c']
[1, 2, 3]
['a', 1, 'b', 2, 'c', 3]
```

## Variables
Allows you to label/name a value and save it to the computer's working memory.
```python
my_int = 3

my_float = 3.14

my_string = 'my string'

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Once a value is in working memory, you can have the computer recall it using the given variable name.
```python
answer = 1 + 2
# show the answer in the output window
print(answer)
# 3
```

You can re-use a variable name for a new value but, the previous value will be forgotten.
```python
answer = 1 + 2 # this value is forgotten
answer = 2 + 2 
print(answer)
# 4
```

A variable can be used in place of any other value.
```python
```

## Logic
A sequence of instructions given to the computer, to follow.
```python
answer = 1 + 1
```

## Branching Logic

## Looping Logic
